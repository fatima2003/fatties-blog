<!-- introduction -->
Type Alignment and Memory Layout in Golang but simple :D
<!--more-->
<!-- rest of the content -->
- Type alignment is Golang is all about how data is arranged to ensure efficient access by the CPU. The starting memory address of a value of a certain type must be a multiple of an integer N. That sounds confusing but what this means is if a value takes up 2 bytes (int16) then the starting memory address should be even, e.g., 100, 102, etc.
