I was going over system design principles and wondered how these principles could be used
on human beings.

## End-to-End Principle
**It posits that application-specific logic should reside in the endpoints (like a user's computer or server) rather than intermediate nodes (like routers or gateways).** 
In day to day living, one can use this principle by cutting off middle men. If you want to communicate with someone
communicate directly without going through other people to increase efficiency and integrity.

## Robustness Principle/ Postel's law
**Be conservative in what you do, be liberal in what you accept from others.**
_Herb Bowie calls it, "a general social code for software: be strict in your own behavior, but tolerant of harmless quirks in others."_
Hold yourself to higher standards and give others room for imperfection. Be precise and intentional in your words and actions, but flexible and forgiving when others miscommunicate or stumble.
- A good example of this would be to trim excess whitespace... something so small but I didn't do this
for one of my first apps and a number of users complained they couldn't login lol.
