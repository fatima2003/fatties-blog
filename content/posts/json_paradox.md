When handling JSON data, it is important to ensure the data conforms to what is expected.
To validate the data, one can use a **JSON schema** which is a JSON document that defines the rules 
another JSON document must obey. Infact you can write a JSON schema to validate other schemas.. this 
is a fascinating paradox: the validator itself must be valid JSON.
