Sometimes you want a function to be able to read the room, to get `context` about what is going on. For instance, if a certain function exits, you want all sub-processes to complete as well. Well, golang can't read body language but it does have a `context` package.
This package lets your code carry cancellation signals, deadlines, and request-scoped values across API boundaries and down into goroutines.

## Key aspects of Go's context:
### Cancellation Signals:
A `context.Context`` can carry a cancellation signal. When a context is canceled, all goroutines that are listening on its `Done()`` channel will be notified, allowing them to gracefully stop their operations. This is crucial for resource management and preventing goroutine leaks.

### Deadlines and Timeouts:
Contexts can be associated with a deadline (a specific time) or a timeout (a duration). If the deadline is reached or the timeout expires, the context is automatically canceled, signaling to dependent goroutines to cease their work.

### Request-Scoped Values:
Contexts allow for the safe passing of immutable, request-scoped values between goroutines without relying on global variables or explicit parameter passing through every function call. This is commonly used for passing tracing information, user authentication details, or request IDs.
