### Sushi Art
The miso soup, sushi and fried calamari is worth the 25 minute walk to the restaurant. The fish used is fresh
and the flavours just melt onto your tongue. Top recs include salmon aburi (seared salman), black dragon 
(smoked eel) and any tuna sushi (∩❛ڡ❛∩) 

### Wagamama
The tantanmen ramen is everything you crave on a windy day. Flavourful broth with the perfect amount of spice!
We love getting extra kimchi on the side 🍜🥢♡ ༘*.ﾟ

### Tashas
I got the chicken pot pie when I went with my mom and savoured every bit of it. Very flavorful and the chicken
was not dry at all. You could tell it just came out of the oven 🙌
