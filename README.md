# My blog

Created using Hugo and used the theme [neopost](https://github.com/salatine/neopost) by @salatine! I modified a few things in the theme to suit my aes more :D

Deployed using vercel. Had this huge layout not found bug, which was fixed by adding a `vercel.json` file with the `vercel` and `go` version as suggested by: https://dev.to/xifm0/step-by-step-guide-to-deploy-hugo-on-vercel-57jb#anchor1
